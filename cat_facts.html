    <h1>Some facts on cats</h1>

    <p>The cat, often called the domestic cat, is typically a small, furry, carnivorous mammal.</p>

    <p>Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.</p>

    <p>Cats can see in near darkness, and like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision.</p>

    <p>Since cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, it is commonly believed that cats were domesticated there</p>

    <p>A group of French archaeologists led by Jean-Denis Vigne discovered there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 7500 BC.</p>

    <p>Unlike other domesticated animals, cats probably domesticated themselves.</p>

    <p><a href="https://tica.org/en/">The International Cat Association</a> currently recognizes 71 breeds of cats for championship competition</p>
